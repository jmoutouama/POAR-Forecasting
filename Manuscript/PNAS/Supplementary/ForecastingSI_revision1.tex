\section*{Supporting Methods}

\subsection*{A. Climatic data collection}
The general circulation models (GCMs) were selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5): Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5), Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS1-3), Community Earth System Model (CESM1-BGC), Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici Climate Model (CMCC-CM).
All the GCMs were also downloaded from Chelsa \citep{sanderson2015representative}.
We evaluated future climate projections from two scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5, an intermediate-to-pessimistic scenario assuming a radiative forcing amounting to 4.5 $W m^{-2}$ by 2100, and RCP8.5, a pessimistic emission scenario which projects a radiative forcing of 8.5 $W m^{-2}$ by 2100 \citep{thomson2011rcp4, schwalm2020rcp8}. 

Projection data for the three 30-year periods included warmer or colder conditions than observed in our experiment, so extending our inferences to these conditions required some extrapolation. 
However, across all sites, both study years were 1-2\degree C warmer than their corresponding ``current'' (1990-2019) temperature normals (Fig. \ref{Sup:climate_normal_weather}). 
Additionally, the 2014--15 growing season was generally wetter and cooler across the study region than 2015--16 (Fig. \ref{Sup:climate_normal_weather}). 
Combined, the geographic and inter-annual replication of the common garden experiment provided good coverage of most past and future conditions throughout the study region (Fig. 1). 

\subsection*{B. Sex-specific demographic responses to climatic variation across common garden sites}
Vital rate models were fit with the same linear predictors for the expected value ($\mu$)(Eq.\ref{eq:mu}):
\begin{align}\label{eq:mu}
\begin{split}
\mu = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}size + \beta_{2}sex + \beta_{3}pptgrow + \beta_{4}pptdorm + \beta_{5}tempgrow + \beta_{6}tempdorm \\ 
+ \beta_{7}pptgrow*sex + \beta_{8}pptdorm*sex + \beta_{9}tempgrow*sex + \beta_{10}tempdorm*sex  \\ 
+  \beta_{11}size*sex + \beta_{12}pptgrow*tempgrow + \beta_{13}pptdorm*tempdorm\\
+ \beta_{14}pptgrow*tempgrow*sex + \beta_{15}pptdorm*tempdorm*sex + \beta_{16}pptgrow^2\\
+ \beta_{17}pptdorm^2 + \beta_{18}tempgrow^2 + \beta_{19}tempdorm^2 + \beta_{20}pptgrow^2*sex  \\
+ \beta_{21}pptdorm^2*sex + \beta_{22}tempgrow^2*sex + \beta_{23}tempdorm^2*sex + \phi + \rho + \nu 
\end{split}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\beta_{0}$ is the  grand mean intercept, $\beta_{1}$ is the size dependent slopes.
$size$ was on a natural logarithm scale. 
$\beta_{2}$...$\beta_{13}$ represent the climate dependent slopes.
$\beta_{14}$...$\beta_{23}$ represent the sex-climate interaction slopes.
$pptgrow$ is the precipitation of the growing season, $tempgrow$ is the temperature of the growing season, $pptdorm$ is the precipitation of the dormant season, $tempdorm$ is the temperature of the dormant season.

All  vital rates  were  fit with second-degree polynomial functions to accommodate the possibility of hump-shaped relationships (reduced demographic performance at both extremes).
We also included two-way interactions between sex and each climate driver and between temperature and precipitation within each season, and a three-way interaction between sex, temperature, and precipitation within each season. 
We modeled survival and flowering data with a Bernoulli distribution and the growth (tiller number) with a zero-truncated Poisson inverse Gaussian distribution. 
Fertility (panicle count conditional on flowering) was modeled as zero-truncated negative binomial. 
We used generic, weakly informative priors to fit coefficients for survival, growth, flowering models ($\beta \sim N(0,\ 1.5)$) and random effect variances ($\sigma \sim Gamma(\gamma (0.1,\ 0.1)$).
We fit fertility model with  also weakly informative priors for coefficients ($\beta \sim N(0,\ 0.15)$).
Different priors  were used for fertility because the panicle model has a large number of parameters relative to the amount of available data (subset of our data) and because these specifics priors help  prevent the model from overfitting. 
Each vital rate also includes normally distributed random effects for block-to-block variation ($\phi \sim N(0,\ \sigma_{block})$), site to site variation ($\nu \sim N(0,\ \sigma_{site})$), and source-to-source variation that is related to the genetic provenence of the transplants used to establish the common garden ($\rho \sim N(0,\ \sigma_{source})$).



\subsection*{C. Sex ratio responses to climatic variation across common garden sites} \label {sssec:sexratio_bayesian}
To understand the impact of climatic variation across common garden sites on \revise {sex ratio (OSR and SR), we used  bayesian models  to propagate the uncertainty in our estimates of the  the expected value ($\nu$)(Eq.\ref{eq:sr_fn})}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:sr_fn}
\begin{split}
	\nu =   \omega_{0}+ \omega_{1}pptgrow + \omega_{2}pptdorm + \omega_{3}tempgrow + \omega_{4}tempdorm + \\
	  \omega_{5}pptgrow^2 + \omega_{6}pptdorm^2 + \omega_{7}tempgrow^2 + \omega_{8}tempdorm^2 + \epsilon\\
\end{split}
\end{align}
\noindent where $OSR$ is the proportion of panicles that were female or proportion of female individuals in the experimental populations, c is the climate. 
$\omega_{0}$ is the intercept, $\omega_{1}$, .... $\omega_{8}$ are the climate dependent slopes. $\epsilon$ is error term.

We modeled the OSR and SR data with a Bernoulli distribution and used non informative priors for each coefficient ($\omega \sim N(0,\ 100)$). 

\subsection*{D. Sex ratio experiment} 
To estimate the probability of seed viability,  the germination rate and the effect of sex-ratio variation on female reproductive success, we conducted a sex-ratio experiment at one site near the center of the range to estimate the effect of sex-ratio variation on female reproductive success.
The details of the experiment are provided in \cite{compagnoni2017can} and \cite{miller2022two}.
Here we provide a summary of the experiment.
We established 124 experimental populations in plots measuring 0.4 x 0.4m and separated by at least 15m from each other.
We varied population density (1-48 plants/plot) and sex ratio (0\%-100\% female) across the experimental populations, and we replicated 34 combinations of density and sex ratio.
We collected panicles from a subset of females in each plot and recorded the number of seeds in each panicle.
We assessed reproductive success (seeds fertilized) using greenhouse-based germination and trazolium-based seed viability assays.
Seed viability was modeled \revise {to propagate the uncertainty in our estimates}  with a binomial distribution where the probability of viability ($v$) was given by:
\begin{align}\label{eq:viab}
	v = v_{0} * (1 - OSR^{\alpha})
\end{align}
\noindent where $OSR$ is the proportion of panicles that were female in the experimental populations.
% The properties of the above function is supported by our previous work \citep{compagnoni2017can}.
% Here, seed viability is maximized at $v_{0}$ as $OSR$ approaches zero (strongly male-biased) and goes to zero as $OSR$ approaches $1$ (strongly female-biased).
$\alpha$ is the parameter that control for how viability declines with increasing female bias.
Further, germination rate was modeled using a binomial distribution to model the germination data from greenhouse trials.
Given that germination was conditional on seed viability, the probability of success was given by the product $v*g$, where $v$ is a function of $OSR$ (Eq. \ref{eq:viab}) and $g$ is assumed to be constant.
